# .NET Evolution - Key Versions and Concepts

> Part of: [C# & OOP Revision Notes - Comprehensive Demonstration Project](../../README.md)

## Overview

This note summarizes major .NET milestones and the shifts that matter in day-to-day
development: runtime unification, tooling, and feature cadence.

## Key Milestones

- .NET Framework (1.0 - 4.8): Windows-only, mature CLR, classic ASP.NET and WCF.
- .NET Core (1.0 - 3.1): Cross-platform, modular, high-performance runtime.
- .NET 5: Unification after .NET Core, single runtime line.
- .NET 6/7/8/9/10: Annual releases, LTS every two years, steady perf gains.

## Why This Matters

- Deployment model changed to side-by-side runtimes.
- ASP.NET Core replaced classic ASP.NET for modern services.
- Performance improvements are version-to-version, not just language-level.
- LTS vs STS affects upgrade and support planning.
