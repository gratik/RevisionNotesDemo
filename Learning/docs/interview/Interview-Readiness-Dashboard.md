Use this dashboard to track interview readiness by role with measurable progress.

## Overall readiness snapshot

| Dimension | Current score (0-10) | Target score (0-10) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend fundamentals |  | 8 |  |
| System design depth |  | 8 |  |
| Reliability/security reasoning |  | 8 |  |
| Communication clarity |  | 8 |  |
| Role-fit confidence |  | 8 |  |

## Role-based score tracker

| Role | Last mock score | Best score | Trend (up/down/flat) | Priority gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend .NET Engineer |  |  |  |  |
| Senior .NET Engineer |  |  |  |  |
| Platform / DevOps |  |  |  |  |
| Solutions Architect |  |  |  |  |

## Weak-signal register

| Weak signal | Evidence from mock | Targeted fix | Due by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing tradeoff depth |  | Add explicit alternative + rationale in every answer |  |
| Vague metrics |  | Include one metric per deep-dive response |  |
| Incomplete failure path |  | Add timeout/retry/rollback details in system answers |  |

## Weekly update loop

1. Run one role mock from `Interview-Role-Mock-Scripts.md`.
2. Score with `Interview-Scoring-Sheets.md`.
3. Update this dashboard (scores, trend, weak-signal register).
4. Do one timed drill from `Interview-Timed-Practice-Sets.md`.
5. Re-check with `Interview-Cheat-Card.md` and `Interview-Last-Day-Revision-Sheet.md`.

## Readiness exit criteria

- At least 3 consecutive mocks at or above target score for primary role.
- No unresolved critical weak signal in failure/recovery reasoning.
- Consistent use of metrics and tradeoffs in deep-dive responses.
- Comfortable 90-second answers on top 8 anchor topics.

## Interview Answer Block

- 30-second answer: The dashboard turns interview prep into a measurable process with role-specific score tracking and targeted improvements.
- 2-minute deep dive: I log each mock score, identify recurring weak signals, apply focused fixes, and track trend until readiness criteria are met.
- Common follow-up: How do you avoid gaming the score?
- Strong response: Require evidence notes for each score and rotate scenarios to test true adaptability.
- Tradeoff callout: Over-tracking without focused practice actions can create false progress.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer

- Bad answer: “I’ve done a lot of prep, I think I’m ready.”
- Strong answer: “My dashboard shows 3 consecutive 8+ scores in my target role, with tradeoff and metric gaps closed in the last two rounds.”
- Why strong wins: It provides objective proof of readiness.

## Interview Timed Drill

- Time box: 10 minutes.
- Prompt: Update this dashboard after a mock and identify one highest-impact next action.
- Required outputs:
  - one updated role score
  - one trend direction
  - one targeted fix with due date
- Self-check score (0-3 each): accuracy, prioritization quality, actionable clarity.
