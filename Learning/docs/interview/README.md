## Interview Answer Block

- 30-second answer: The interview hub centralizes all preparation assets into one predictable structure for faster navigation.
- 2-minute deep dive: I use this hub to choose role track, run timed drills, score mock rounds, and close weak signals iteratively.
- Common follow-up: How should beginners start?
- Strong response: Begin with answer blocks and timed sets, then move into role scripts and scoring sheets.
- Tradeoff callout: Jumping directly to advanced whiteboard prompts can reduce confidence if fundamentals are not stable first.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer

- Bad answer: “I’ll just read random interview notes.”
- Strong answer: “I follow the hub sequence: answer blocks, timed sets, role scripts, scoring sheets, then dashboard updates.”
- Why strong wins: It demonstrates structured, repeatable preparation.

## Interview Timed Drill

- Time box: 8 minutes.
- Prompt: Pick one role and choose the next three interview assets from this hub in priority order.
- Required outputs:
  - one sequence of assets
  - one goal per asset
  - one measurable target for the round
- Self-check score (0-3 each): prioritization, clarity, measurability.
