## Sprint goals

- Complete at least 3 timed rounds.
- Improve primary role score by at least 1 point.
- Close at least 2 weak-signal items from dashboard.
- Practice one behavioral-to-technical STAR story.

## End-of-sprint review

1. Which role score improved most?
2. Which weak signal remains highest risk?
3. Which answer type still lacks metrics/tradeoffs?
4. What changes in next sprint plan?

## Interview Answer Block

- 30-second answer: The weekly sprint planner makes interview preparation repeatable with daily focus, measurable outputs, and role alignment.
- 2-minute deep dive: I run a 7-day cycle across answer quality, timed execution, role mocks, scoring, and final polish, then use dashboard trends to plan the next sprint.
- Common follow-up: What if you only have three days?
- Strong response: Collapse the plan to Days 1, 3, and 6 with one high-intensity mock and a focused weak-signal fix.
- Tradeoff callout: Covering too many topics in one sprint lowers quality retention.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer

- Bad answer: “I practiced a bit each day.”
- Strong answer: “I followed a 7-day sprint with role-targeted mocks, tracked scores, and closed two weak-signal gaps with measurable improvements.”
- Why strong wins: It shows disciplined execution and objective progress.

## Interview Timed Drill

- Time box: 10 minutes.
- Prompt: Draft your next 7-day sprint using this template for your target role.
- Required outputs:
  - one daily plan
  - one measurable goal
  - one risk and mitigation for the sprint
- Self-check score (0-3 each): realism, role fit, measurable planning.
