## Notes

- `Learning/DataAccess` remains the canonical implementation path for data technologies.
- `Learning/Database` remains a concept/comparison catalog and is reference-only (excluded from project compile items).
- Re-run coverage checks when adding a new doc page or introducing a new top-level topic folder.

## Interview Answer Block

- 30-second answer: This topic covers Documentation-to-code coverage governance and focuses on clear decisions, practical tradeoffs, and production-safe defaults.
- 2-minute deep dive: Start with the core problem, explain the implementation boundary, show one failure mode, and describe the mitigation or optimization strategy.
- Common follow-up: How would you apply this in a real system with constraints?
- Strong response: State assumptions, compare at least two approaches, and justify the chosen option with reliability, maintainability, and performance impact.
- Tradeoff callout: Over-engineering this area too early can increase complexity without measurable delivery or runtime benefit.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer

- Bad answer: "I know coverage and documentation governance and I would just follow best practices."
- Strong answer: "For coverage and documentation governance, I first define the constraints, compare two viable approaches, justify the choice with concrete tradeoffs, and describe how I would validate outcomes in production."
- Why strong wins: It demonstrates structured reasoning, context awareness, and measurable execution rather than generic statements.

## Interview Timed Drill

- Time box: 10 minutes.
- Prompt: Explain how you would apply coverage and documentation governance in a real project with one concrete constraint (scale, security, latency, or team size).
- Required outputs:
  - One design or implementation decision
  - One risk and mitigation
  - One measurable validation signal
- Self-check score (0-3 each): correctness, tradeoff clarity, communication clarity.
