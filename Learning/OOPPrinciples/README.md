# OOP Principles Guide

## Learning goals

- Understand the main concepts covered in OOPPrinciples.
- Compare baseline and recommended implementation approaches.
- Apply the patterns in runnable project examples.

## Prerequisites

- Classes, interfaces, inheritance
- Basic refactoring familiarity

## Runnable examples

- DependencyInversionPrinciple.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- InterfaceSegregationPrinciple.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- KISSDRYYAGNIExamples.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- OpenClosedPrinciple.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- SingleResponsibilityPrinciple.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- TellDontAskPrinciple.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code

Run examples from the project root:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Bad vs good examples summary

- Bad: brittle or overly coupled approach that reduces maintainability.
- Good: clear, testable, and production-oriented implementation pattern.
- Why it matters: consistent patterns improve readability, reliability, and onboarding speed.
