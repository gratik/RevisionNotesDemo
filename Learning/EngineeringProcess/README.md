# Engineering Process Guide

## Learning goals

- Convert backlog intent into implementable, low-risk engineering tasks.
- Raise code review quality and delivery predictability.
- Align definition-of-done, test expectations, and technical documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Core software delivery lifecycle familiarity
- Unit/integration testing basics

## Runnable examples

- BacklogRefinementAndTicketDesign.cs - Translating roadmap items into implementation slices
- CodeReviewStandards.cs - Review criteria and defect-prevention focus
- DefinitionOfDoneAndAcceptanceCriteria.cs - Clear completion and quality gates
- TechnicalDocumentationStandards.cs - Practical standards for maintainable docs

Run examples from the project root:

```bash
dotnet run --section engineering-process
```

## Bad vs good examples summary

- Bad: ambiguous tickets, weak acceptance criteria, and subjective review outcomes.
- Good: explicit scope, measurable DoD, and risk-focused review checklists.
- Why it matters: process quality compounds into delivery speed and defect rate.
