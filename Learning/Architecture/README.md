# Architecture Guide

## Learning goals

- Understand the main concepts covered in Architecture.
- Compare baseline and recommended implementation approaches.
- Apply the patterns in runnable project examples.

## Prerequisites

- OOP and domain modeling fundamentals
- Basic distributed-system concepts

## Runnable examples

- ArchitectureDecisionRecords.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- CleanArchitectureAdvanced.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- EndToEndCaseStudy.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- IntegratedDomainSlicesCaseStudy.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- HexagonalArchitectureExamples.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- ScalableProjectStructure.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- VerticalSliceArchitecture.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code

Run examples from the project root:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Bad vs good examples summary

- Bad: brittle or overly coupled approach that reduces maintainability.
- Good: clear, testable, and production-oriented implementation pattern.
- Why it matters: consistent patterns improve readability, reliability, and onboarding speed.
