# Cloud Guide

## Learning goals

- Understand the main concepts covered in Cloud.
- Compare baseline and recommended implementation approaches.
- Apply the patterns in runnable project examples.

## Prerequisites

- Container and deployment basics
- Core Azure service awareness

## Runnable examples

- AzureAppServicePatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureCosmosDBPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureDeploymentAndDevOps.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureDockerHostingPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureFunctionsServerless.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureFunctionsWithDocker.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureKeyVaultSecrets.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureMicroservicesHosting.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureServiceBusPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureEventHubPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureEventGridPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureStorageAndDataHosting.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- AzureStoragePatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code

Run examples from the project root:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Bad vs good examples summary

- Bad: brittle or overly coupled approach that reduces maintainability.
- Good: clear, testable, and production-oriented implementation pattern.
- Why it matters: consistent patterns improve readability, reliability, and onboarding speed.
