# Practical Patterns Guide

## Learning goals

- Understand the main concepts covered in PracticalPatterns.
- Compare baseline and recommended implementation approaches.
- Apply the patterns in runnable project examples.

## Prerequisites

- Core C# and DI basics
- Basic API development flow

## Runnable examples

- ApiOptimization.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- BackgroundServicesDemo.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- BackgroundWorkersInDotNet.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- CachingImplementation.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- GlobalExceptionHandling.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- MappingPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- OptionsPatternDemo.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- SerializationExamples.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code
- ValidationPatterns.cs - Topic implementation and demonstration code

Run examples from the project root:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Bad vs good examples summary

- Bad: brittle or overly coupled approach that reduces maintainability.
- Good: clear, testable, and production-oriented implementation pattern.
- Why it matters: consistent patterns improve readability, reliability, and onboarding speed.
