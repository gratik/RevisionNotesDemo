- Priority modules:
  - `Core-CSharp.md`
  - `Web-API-MVC.md`
  - `Data-Access.md`
  - `Testing.md`
  - `Security.md`
- Must-demonstrate outcomes:
  - Clear API contract design
  - Practical EF/Dapper tradeoff decisions
  - Reliable unit/integration test strategy

## Senior .NET Engineer

- Priority modules:
  - `Design-Patterns.md`
  - `Performance.md`
  - `Resilience.md`
  - `Logging-Observability.md`
  - `Distributed-Consistency.md`
- Must-demonstrate outcomes:
  - Tradeoff-led architecture choices
  - Production failure-mode mitigation
  - Performance and reliability measurement strategy

## Platform / DevOps Engineer

- Priority modules:
  - `Deployment-DevOps.md`
  - `HealthChecks.md`
  - `Build-Warning-Triage.md`
  - `Suppression-Audit.md`
  - `Azure-Hosting.md`
- Must-demonstrate outcomes:
  - CI/CD quality gates
  - Rollout and rollback confidence
  - Operability metrics and incident feedback loops

## Solutions Architect

- Priority modules:
  - `Domain-Driven-Design.md`
  - `Message-Architecture.md`
  - `Distributed-Consistency.md`
  - `End-to-End-Case-Study.md`
  - `Project-Structure-Inventory.md`
- Must-demonstrate outcomes:
  - System boundary and ownership decisions
  - Consistency and failure strategy clarity
  - Scalable governance and delivery standards

## Suggested weekly prep loop

1. Select one role track and one module/day.
2. Use the module’s `Interview Answer Block`.
3. Run one `Interview Timed Drill`.
4. Compare with `Interview Bad vs Strong Answer`.
5. Record one weak area and repeat next day.

## Interview Answer Block

- 30-second answer: Role tracks help prioritize preparation by mapping expectations to the most relevant modules.
- 2-minute deep dive: I pick a target role, focus on priority modules, and practice concise outcome-based answers tied to measurable impact.
- Common follow-up: How do you adapt when applying for multiple roles?
- Strong response: Keep a shared core prep set, then add role-specific deep dives and examples.
- Tradeoff callout: Over-customizing too early can fragment prep and reduce repetition quality.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer

- Bad answer: "I study everything equally and hope the role fit is obvious."
- Strong answer: "I map role expectations to focused modules, practice role-specific examples, and validate readiness with timed drills and feedback."
- Why strong wins: It shows deliberate prioritization and evidence-based preparation.

## Interview Timed Drill

- Time box: 10 minutes.
- Prompt: Choose one role and explain your 7-day prep plan with module priorities and measurable outcomes.
- Required outputs:
  - One prioritized module sequence
  - One role-specific risk and mitigation
  - One readiness metric
- Self-check score (0-3 each): role fit clarity, tradeoff quality, communication clarity.
