Use this log to track each mock session and make progress measurable across weeks.

## Session log template

| Date | Role track | Script used | Score | Top strength | Top gap | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Weekly summary template

| Week | Mocks completed | Avg score | Best score | Weak signal closed | Next-week focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Signal checklist per session

- Tradeoff stated explicitly
- One measurable metric included
- Failure/recovery path explained
- Security/operability considered
- Role-specific depth demonstrated

## Progress rules

1. Log every mock immediately after completion.
2. Set one concrete next action per session.
3. Update readiness dashboard weekly.
4. Keep weak-signal backlog to top 3 active items.

## Interview Answer Block

- 30-second answer: A progress log makes interview preparation evidence-driven by recording what improved and what still blocks readiness.
- 2-minute deep dive: I track scores, strength/gap patterns, and next actions per session, then use weekly summaries to adjust role focus and drill intensity.
- Common follow-up: How do you keep the log useful instead of noisy?
- Strong response: Capture only high-signal fields and enforce one measurable next action per entry.
- Tradeoff callout: Excessive detail in logs can reduce execution speed and consistency.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer

- Bad answer: “I’ve practiced a lot recently.”
- Strong answer: “My last 5 mocks average 8.2/10, and I closed two weak signals by adding explicit tradeoff and metric statements in architecture answers.”
- Why strong wins: It proves progress with concrete evidence.

## Interview Timed Drill

- Time box: 8 minutes.
- Prompt: Fill one new session row and one weekly summary row from your latest mock.
- Required outputs:
  - one completed session entry
  - one measurable next action
  - one weekly focus priority
- Self-check score (0-3 each): evidence quality, actionability, clarity.
