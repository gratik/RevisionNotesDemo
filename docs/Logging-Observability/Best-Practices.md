## Best Practices

### ✅ Logging Guidelines
- Use structured logging (templates, not interpolation)
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Use appropriate log levels
- Add correlation IDs for request tracing
- Use log scopes for grouping related logs
- Include timing information for operations

### ✅ Performance
- Use LoggerMessage for hot paths
- Check IsEnabled before expensive operations
- Avoid logging in tight loops
- Don't serialize large objects unless necessary
- Use async logging providers where available

### ✅ Security
- Never log passwords or secrets
- Sanitize PII (personally identifiable information)
- Be careful with sensitive data in exceptions
- Use separate logs for security events

## Detailed Guidance

Best Practices guidance focuses on turning this topic into explicit, measurable engineering decisions rather than abstract rules.

### Design Notes
- Define success criteria for Best Practices before implementation work begins.
- Keep boundaries explicit so Best Practices decisions do not leak accidental complexity into adjacent layers.
- Prefer simpler implementations first, then optimize based on measured constraints.
- Make failure behavior explicit (timeouts, retries, validation, rollback, or compensation) where applicable.

### When To Use
- When introducing or refactoring Best Practices in production-facing code.
- When performance, correctness, or maintainability depends on consistent Best Practices decisions.
- When design reviews require concrete tradeoffs and validation signals.

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Applying Best Practices as a checklist item without tying it to workload and constraints.
- Large, multi-axis changes that make regression root-cause analysis difficult.
- Shipping without measurable before/after signals for the chosen approach.

## Practical Example

- Choose one high-impact path where Best Practices is currently weak or inconsistent.
- Apply one bounded improvement and document the expected behavior change.
- Validate with tests and runtime metrics, then capture rollback conditions.

## Validation Checklist

- Design assumptions for Best Practices are documented and reviewable.
- Tests cover both happy path and at least one realistic failure path.
- Metrics/logging expose the primary risk this topic addresses.
- Operational ownership is clear if behavior regresses in production.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Best Practices is about telemetry design for diagnostics and operations. It matters because good observability shortens detection and recovery times.
- Use it when correlating logs, traces, and metrics across service boundaries.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Best Practices solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: high-cardinality detail vs telemetry cost/noise.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: missing correlation context during incident response.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Best Practices but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Best Practices, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Best Practices and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Best Practices with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
