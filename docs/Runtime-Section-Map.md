This page maps runtime sections to learning folders so learners can quickly locate source files.

## Runtime Sections

- `oop` -> `Learning/OOPPrinciples`
- `clean-code` -> `Learning/OOPPrinciples` (KISS/DRY/YAGNI/TDA)
- `creational` -> `Learning/DesignPatterns/Creational`
- `structural` -> `Learning/DesignPatterns/Structural`
- `behavioral` -> `Learning/DesignPatterns/Behavioral`
- `memory` -> `Learning/MemoryManagement`
- `async` -> `Learning/AsyncMultithreading`
- `dotnet` -> `Learning/CoreCSharpFeatures`, `Learning/LINQAndQueries`, `Learning/AdvancedCSharp`
- `practical` -> `Learning/PracticalPatterns`, `Learning/Models`
- `appendices` -> `Learning/Appendices`
- `cloud` -> `Learning/Cloud`
- `microservices` -> `Learning/Microservices`
- `architecture` -> `Learning/Architecture`
- `devops` -> `Learning/DevOps`
- `observability` -> `Learning/Observability`
- `security` -> `Learning/Security`

## Topics Not Run As Standalone Sections

These are discoverable as docs and examples but are not separate runtime section keys:

- `Learning/Configuration`
- `Learning/DataAccess`
- `Learning/DomainDrivenDesign`
- `Learning/FrontEnd`
- `Learning/HealthChecks`
- `Learning/Logging`
- `Learning/ModernCSharp`
- `Learning/RealTime`
- `Learning/Resilience`
- `Learning/Testing` (compiled out of main demo app)
- `Learning/WebAPI`

Use docs index and learning path for navigation:

- [Docs Index](../README.md)
- [Learning Path](Learning-Path.md)
