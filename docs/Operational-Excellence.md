## Study Flow

1. Define incident handling and service ownership boundaries.
2. Establish SLO-driven alerting and mitigation playbooks.
3. Validate on-call readiness through recurring drills and postmortems.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Operational-Excellence is about incident response and service reliability operations. It matters because operational rigor keeps systems stable under real production pressure.
- Use it when defining SLOs, runbooks, and escalation practices.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Operational-Excellence solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: process rigor vs delivery overhead.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: unclear ownership and playbooks during incidents.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Operational-Excellence but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Operational-Excellence, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Operational-Excellence and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Operational-Excellence with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
