## Study Flow

1. Shape backlog tickets into clear, testable technical slices.
2. Apply review and quality gates consistently.
3. Keep DoD and documentation aligned with operational outcomes.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Engineering-Process is about team practices for predictable delivery quality. It matters because process quality affects defect rates and delivery flow.
- Use it when improving review, planning, and definition-of-done consistency.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Engineering-Process solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: governance structure vs execution speed.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: process checklists with weak ownership and feedback loops.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Engineering-Process but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Engineering-Process, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Engineering-Process and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Engineering-Process with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
