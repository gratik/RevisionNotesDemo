# Azure IoT Hub Patterns

Use IoT Hub as the secure control plane for device identity, ingress, routing, and command paths.

## Key points

- Separate telemetry ingestion from command/control responsibilities.
- Use device-level identity and authorization.
- Route by message type and tenant/site boundaries.
- Track ingest latency, failed auth, and message loss indicators.
