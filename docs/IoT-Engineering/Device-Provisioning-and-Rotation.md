# Device Provisioning and Rotation

## Operational baseline

- Use automated secure provisioning with unique device identity.
- Rotate credentials/certificates and revoke compromised devices quickly.
- Record identity lifecycle events for auditing and forensics.
- Alert on unusual registration churn and repeated auth failures.
