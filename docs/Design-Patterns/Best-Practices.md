## Best Practices

### ✅ When to Use Patterns
- Use patterns to solve specific problems, not because they exist
- Prefer simple solutions over complex patterns
- Consider maintainability (will others understand this?)
- Don't force patterns where they don't fit

### ✅ Common Patterns in C#/.NET
- **Repository + Unit of Work** for data access
- **Strategy** for interchangeable algorithms
- **Decorator** for adding behavior (middleware)
- **Factory** for object creation
- **Observer** for event handling
