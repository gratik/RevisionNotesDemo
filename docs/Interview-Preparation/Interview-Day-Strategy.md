## Interview Day Strategy

### Before the Interview

- [ ] Review company's tech stack
- [ ] Prepare 3-5 questions to ask interviewer
- [ ] Review your own projects/resume
- [ ] Practice coding on whiteboard/paper
- [ ] Get good sleep

### During Technical Questions

1. **Clarify requirements**: Ask about edge cases, constraints
2. **Think out loud**: Share your reasoning
3. **Start simple**: Get basic solution working first
4. **Optimize**: Discuss time/space complexity improvements
5. **Test**: Walk through example inputs

### Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ Saying "I don't know" without attempting
- ❌ Jumping to code without clarifying
- ❌ Getting defensive about feedback
- ❌ Not asking questions
- ❌ Bad-mouthing previous employers

### Green Flags to Show

- ✅ Asking clarifying questions
- ✅ Discussing trade-offs
- ✅ Mentioning testing
