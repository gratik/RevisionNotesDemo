## Salary Negotiation Tips

### Research First

- Check Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Payscale
- Know your market value
- Consider total compensation (benefits, equity, bonus)

### When Asked "What's your expected salary?"

**Strategy 1**: "I'm flexible and open to discussing the entire compensation package. What's the budgeted range for this role?"

**Strategy 2**: "Based on my research and experience, I'm targeting $X to $Y. Is that within the range for this position?"

### Negotiation Tips

- ✅ Ask for time to review offer
- ✅ Negotiate total package (not just salary)
- ✅ Be prepared to justify your ask
- ✅ Get it in writing
- ❌ Don't accept first offer immediately
- ❌ Don't make ultimatums
