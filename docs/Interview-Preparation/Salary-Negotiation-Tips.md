## Salary Negotiation Tips

### Research First

- Check Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Payscale
- Know your market value
- Consider total compensation (benefits, equity, bonus)

### When Asked "What's your expected salary?"

**Strategy 1**: "I'm flexible and open to discussing the entire compensation package. What's the budgeted range for this role?"

**Strategy 2**: "Based on my research and experience, I'm targeting $X to $Y. Is that within the range for this position?"

### Negotiation Tips

- ✅ Ask for time to review offer
- ✅ Negotiate total package (not just salary)
- ✅ Be prepared to justify your ask
- ✅ Get it in writing
- ❌ Don't accept first offer immediately
- ❌ Don't make ultimatums

## Detailed Guidance

Salary Negotiation Tips guidance focuses on turning this topic into explicit, measurable engineering decisions rather than abstract rules.

### Design Notes
- Define success criteria for Salary Negotiation Tips before implementation work begins.
- Keep boundaries explicit so Salary Negotiation Tips decisions do not leak accidental complexity into adjacent layers.
- Prefer simpler implementations first, then optimize based on measured constraints.
- Make failure behavior explicit (timeouts, retries, validation, rollback, or compensation) where applicable.

### When To Use
- When introducing or refactoring Salary Negotiation Tips in production-facing code.
- When performance, correctness, or maintainability depends on consistent Salary Negotiation Tips decisions.
- When design reviews require concrete tradeoffs and validation signals.

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Applying Salary Negotiation Tips as a checklist item without tying it to workload and constraints.
- Large, multi-axis changes that make regression root-cause analysis difficult.
- Shipping without measurable before/after signals for the chosen approach.

## Practical Example

- Choose one high-impact path where Salary Negotiation Tips is currently weak or inconsistent.
- Apply one bounded improvement and document the expected behavior change.
- Validate with tests and runtime metrics, then capture rollback conditions.

## Validation Checklist

- Design assumptions for Salary Negotiation Tips are documented and reviewable.
- Tests cover both happy path and at least one realistic failure path.
- Metrics/logging expose the primary risk this topic addresses.
- Operational ownership is clear if behavior regresses in production.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Salary Negotiation Tips is about communication structure for technical interviews. It matters because clear articulation of tradeoffs improves interview signal quality.
- Use it when translating implementation knowledge into concise answers.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Salary Negotiation Tips solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: brevity vs sufficient technical depth.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: memorized answers that ignore problem context.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Salary Negotiation Tips but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Salary Negotiation Tips, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Salary Negotiation Tips and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Salary Negotiation Tips with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
