## Why Resilience Matters

**The Reality**: Failures are inevitable
- Network timeouts
- Database deadlocks
- Service overload
- Temporary outages

**The Solution**: Handle failures predictably
- Retry transient errors
- Prevent cascading failures
- Fail fast when appropriate
- Give services time to recover
