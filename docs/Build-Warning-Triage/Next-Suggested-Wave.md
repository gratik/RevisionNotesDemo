## Next Suggested Wave

1. Re-evaluate scoped suppressions periodically and convert suppressions to fixes when examples are refactored.
2. Keep new additions warning-clean by default; only add scoped suppressions with explicit educational rationale.
3. Preserve this warning policy in PR reviews (no blanket `NoWarn` additions without discussion).
