## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Backlog Shaping and Implementation Specs is about team practices for predictable delivery quality. It matters because process quality affects defect rates and delivery flow.
- Use it when improving review, planning, and definition-of-done consistency.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Backlog Shaping and Implementation Specs solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: governance structure vs execution speed.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: process checklists with weak ownership and feedback loops.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Backlog Shaping and Implementation Specs but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Backlog Shaping and Implementation Specs, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Backlog Shaping and Implementation Specs and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Backlog Shaping and Implementation Specs with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
