- Co-evolve docs with code in the same change.
- Include ownership, dependencies, and troubleshooting entry points.
- Keep decision records short and auditable.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Summarize the core concept in one sentence and name one practical use case.

2-minute answer:
- Explain the concept, key tradeoffs, and one implementation detail or pitfall.

## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Gives a definition only without tradeoffs, examples, or failure modes.

Strong answer:
- Defines the concept, compares alternatives, and cites a concrete production scenario.

## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define the topic and one reason it matters.
- 3 minutes: explain architecture, tradeoffs, and one troubleshooting example.
