## Metadata
- Owner: RevisionNotes Maintainers
- Last updated: February 17, 2026
- Prerequisites: Version control workflow, code review basics, and agile delivery fundamentals.
- Related examples: docs/Engineering-Process/README.md
## Documentation rules

- Keep architecture intent and failure modes explicit.
- Co-evolve docs with code in the same change.
- Include ownership, dependencies, and troubleshooting entry points.
- Keep decision records short and auditable.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Technical Documentation Standards is about team practices for predictable delivery quality. It matters because process quality affects defect rates and delivery flow.
- Use it when improving review, planning, and definition-of-done consistency.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Technical Documentation Standards solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: governance structure vs execution speed.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: process checklists with weak ownership and feedback loops.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Technical Documentation Standards but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Technical Documentation Standards, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Technical Documentation Standards and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Technical Documentation Standards with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
