## Deployment and DevOps on Azure

### CI/CD Baseline

- Build and test every change
- Run SAST/SCA and container scans
- Validate IaC (Bicep/Terraform)
- Deploy to staging with smoke tests
- Promote to production behind approval gates

### Release Safety Controls

- Feature flags for gradual exposure
- Automated rollback triggers from health/SLO breaches
- Environment drift detection via IaC
- Audit trail from commit to deployment
