## Azure Functions with Docker

### When to Dockerize Functions

- Native dependencies are required
- You need strict runtime version control
- Local and cloud parity must be exact

### Hosting Notes

- Consumption: cheapest for spiky traffic
- Premium: warm instances, VNet, lower cold start impact
- Dedicated: predictable baseline and long-running workloads
