# Key Concepts

> Subject: [LINQ-Queries](../README.md)

## Key Concepts

- Deferred execution and query composition
- IQueryable for remote providers (EF Core) vs IEnumerable in-memory
- Projections to avoid over-fetching

## Detailed Guidance

Key Concepts should emphasize compile-time safety, readability, and maintainable abstractions rather than clever type tricks.

### Design Notes
- Use language features to enforce intent at compile time (constraints, nullability, variance).
- Keep APIs narrow and intention-revealing; avoid generic over-engineering.
- Prefer composition and small interfaces over deep inheritance chains.
- Document where performance optimizations justify additional complexity.

### When To Use
- When building reusable libraries or framework-facing APIs.
- When replacing runtime casts/dynamic code with typed contracts.
- When teaching or reviewing core language design tradeoffs.

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Public APIs with too many type parameters and unclear semantics.
- Constraints that do not correspond to required operations.
- Using reflection/dynamic where static typing is sufficient.

## Practical Example

- Start with a concrete implementation and extract generic behavior only when duplication appears.
- Add minimal constraints needed for compile-time guarantees.
- Validate with tests across reference and value type scenarios.

## Validation Checklist

- API signatures are understandable without deep internal context.
- Nullability and constraints match true invariants.
- Type misuse fails at compile time where possible.
- Benchmarks exist for any non-trivial performance optimizations.
