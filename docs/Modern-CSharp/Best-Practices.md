## Best Practices

### ✅ Records
- Use for immutable DTOs and value objects
- Prefer `record` over `class` for data transfer
- Use `with` expressions for non-destructive updates
- Don't use for entities with identity

### ✅ Pattern Matching
- Use `switch` expressions for multiple branches
- Combine with LINQ for powerful queries
- Use property patterns to eliminate null checks
- Prefer pattern matching over multiple if/else

### ✅ Nullable Reference Types
- Enable `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` in all projects
- Use `?` to explicitly mark nullable references
- Initialize properties in constructors
- Use `required` for mandatory properties (C# 11+)

### ✅ Init-Only Properties
- Use for immutable objects
- Combine with records for clean syntax
- Prefer over constructor-only initialization

## Detailed Guidance

Best Practices should emphasize compile-time safety, readability, and maintainable abstractions rather than clever type tricks.

### Design Notes
- Use language features to enforce intent at compile time (constraints, nullability, variance).
- Keep APIs narrow and intention-revealing; avoid generic over-engineering.
- Prefer composition and small interfaces over deep inheritance chains.
- Document where performance optimizations justify additional complexity.

### When To Use
- When building reusable libraries or framework-facing APIs.
- When replacing runtime casts/dynamic code with typed contracts.
- When teaching or reviewing core language design tradeoffs.

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Public APIs with too many type parameters and unclear semantics.
- Constraints that do not correspond to required operations.
- Using reflection/dynamic where static typing is sufficient.

## Practical Example

- Start with a concrete implementation and extract generic behavior only when duplication appears.
- Add minimal constraints needed for compile-time guarantees.
- Validate with tests across reference and value type scenarios.

## Validation Checklist

- API signatures are understandable without deep internal context.
- Nullability and constraints match true invariants.
- Type misuse fails at compile time where possible.
- Benchmarks exist for any non-trivial performance optimizations.

## Interview Answer Block
30-second answer:
- Best Practices is about newer C# language capabilities. It matters because modern syntax reduces boilerplate and improves intent clarity.
- Use it when updating legacy code to safer and more expressive patterns.

2-minute answer:
- Start with the problem Best Practices solves in this module and the baseline implementation approach.
- Discuss a key tradeoff: new language features vs team familiarity and consistency.
- Close with one failure mode and mitigation: mixing old and new idioms inconsistently across the same codebase.
## Interview Bad vs Strong Answer
Bad answer:
- Defines Best Practices but skips constraints, alternatives, and production impact.

Strong answer:
- Explains when to choose Best Practices, what to compare it against, and how to validate it in tests/operations.
## Interview Timed Drill
- 60 seconds: define Best Practices and map it to one concrete implementation in this module.
- 3 minutes: compare Best Practices with an alternative, then walk through one failure mode and mitigation.
