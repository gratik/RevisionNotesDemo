## Why DevOps Matters

**Development to Production Gap**:

- Code works on your machine → fails in production
- Manual deployments → human errors
- No versioning → rollback nightmares
- No automation → slow releases

**DevOps Solves**:

- Consistent environments (Docker)
- Automated deployments (CI/CD)
- Easy scaling (Kubernetes)
- Fast rollback (versioned containers)
- Infrastructure as code
