## Study Flow

1. Read the subject README for scope and boundaries.
2. Work through topic files relevant to your current project constraints.
3. Capture decisions as measurable changes, then validate in runtime telemetry.

## Detailed Guidance

Modern-CSharp should emphasize compile-time safety, readability, and maintainable abstractions rather than clever type tricks.

### Design Notes
- Use language features to enforce intent at compile time (constraints, nullability, variance).
- Keep APIs narrow and intention-revealing; avoid generic over-engineering.
- Prefer composition and small interfaces over deep inheritance chains.
- Document where performance optimizations justify additional complexity.

### When To Use
- When building reusable libraries or framework-facing APIs.
- When replacing runtime casts/dynamic code with typed contracts.
- When teaching or reviewing core language design tradeoffs.

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Public APIs with too many type parameters and unclear semantics.
- Constraints that do not correspond to required operations.
- Using reflection/dynamic where static typing is sufficient.

## Practical Example

- Start with a concrete implementation and extract generic behavior only when duplication appears.
- Add minimal constraints needed for compile-time guarantees.
- Validate with tests across reference and value type scenarios.

## Validation Checklist

- API signatures are understandable without deep internal context.
- Nullability and constraints match true invariants.
- Type misuse fails at compile time where possible.
- Benchmarks exist for any non-trivial performance optimizations.
