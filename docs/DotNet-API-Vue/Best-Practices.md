# Best Practices

> Subject: [DotNet-API-Vue](../README.md)

## Best Practices

1. Use a shared axios instance with request/response interceptors.
2. Keep token injection and error normalization in one place.
3. Implement composables (`useProducts`, `useOrders`) for loading/error lifecycle.
4. Use Vite proxy in local dev to reduce CORS drift.
5. Return validation and fault details as standard `ProblemDetails`.
6. Enforce server-side pagination boundaries (`pageSize` limits).
7. Keep response payloads small via list-specific DTOs.

## Detailed Guidance

API guidance focuses on contract stability, secure input/output handling, and production-ready observability.

### Design Notes
- Define success criteria for Best Practices before implementation work begins.
- Keep boundaries explicit so Best Practices decisions do not leak accidental complexity into adjacent layers.
- Prefer simpler implementations first, then optimize based on measured constraints.
- Make failure behavior explicit (timeouts, retries, validation, rollback, or compensation) where applicable.

### When To Use
- When introducing or refactoring Best Practices in production-facing code.
- When performance, correctness, or maintainability depends on consistent Best Practices decisions.
- When design reviews require concrete tradeoffs and validation signals.

### Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Applying Best Practices as a checklist item without tying it to workload and constraints.
- Large, multi-axis changes that make regression root-cause analysis difficult.
- Shipping without measurable before/after signals for the chosen approach.

## Practical Example

- Choose one high-impact path where Best Practices is currently weak or inconsistent.
- Apply one bounded improvement and document the expected behavior change.
- Validate with tests and runtime metrics, then capture rollback conditions.

## Validation Checklist

- Design assumptions for Best Practices are documented and reviewable.
- Tests cover both happy path and at least one realistic failure path.
- Metrics/logging expose the primary risk this topic addresses.
- Operational ownership is clear if behavior regresses in production.
